## Complete Conversation Summary
The user reported that the superadmin dashboard was not updating when contracts were created from the three locations (Cancano, Arnoga, and Campo Sportivo). I investigated this issue by analyzing the system architecture and data flow.

First, I explored the project structure and identified the key components: a React frontend with a Dashboard component and a Node.js backend with MongoDB. The system has three locations (Cancano, Arnoga, Campo Sportivo) managed by location-specific admin users, plus a superadmin user who should see aggregated statistics from all locations.

I examined the Dashboard.jsx file and found that the superadmin view calls the `/api/reports/superadmin-stats` endpoint to fetch aggregated statistics. This endpoint in the backend (reportController.js) queries contracts with specific status filters: either `status: 'completed'` OR `status: 'returned'` with `paymentCompleted: true`.

The investigation revealed the contract lifecycle: contracts start as 'in-use', can be moved to 'returned', and finally to 'completed'. The key issue was understanding which contracts should be counted in superadmin statistics.

I created debugging scripts to examine the actual database state and discovered that contracts DO exist in the database for all three locations:
- Cancano: 2 completed contracts, €46.00
- Arnoga: 2 completed contracts, €46.00  
- Campo Sportivo: 2 completed contracts, €46.00
- Total: 7 contracts, €148.00

This indicated that the data exists in the database and the backend logic should be working correctly. The contracts have `status: 'completed'` which matches the filter criteria in the superadmin stats query.

I started the system (backend and frontend) to test the API directly and was preparing to create a test script to verify the API endpoint functionality when the conversation ended. The next steps would be to test the actual API call with proper authentication to determine if the issue is in the API response, frontend data handling, or the dashboard refresh mechanism.

The problem appears to be either in the frontend not properly calling the API, not handling the response correctly, or a caching/refresh issue in the dashboard component. The auto-refresh mechanism runs every 30 seconds, so there might be a timing or authentication issue preventing the superadmin from seeing the updated statistics.
