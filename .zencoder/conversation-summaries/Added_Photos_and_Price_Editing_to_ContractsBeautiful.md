## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on enhancing the ContractsBeautiful component with two key features while maintaining the existing layout: displaying inventory photos for scanned bikes and enabling price editing for individual items.

The initial request was to add photos from the inventory for each scanned bike and provide the ability to change prices for every added item in ContractsBeautiful, with the explicit requirement not to modify the layout or other existing functionality.

However, the conversation began by addressing a critical issue discovered in the system: contracts were disappearing after item returns even when not paid. This led to a comprehensive fix of the payment workflow:

**Major System Fix Implemented:**
1. **New Contract Status**: Added "returned" status to the Contract model to distinguish between returned items (not yet paid) and completed contracts
2. **Modified Return Logic**: Changed the backend controller so returned contracts go to "returned" status instead of "completed"
3. **Payment Completion System**: Created a new API endpoint `/api/contracts/:id/complete-payment` to handle final payment processing
4. **Enhanced Contract Manager**: Added a "Da Pagare" filter and comprehensive payment modal with detailed billing, payment method selection, and notes
5. **Workflow Improvement**: Established proper flow: in-use → returned → completed (after payment)

**ContractsBeautiful Enhancements:**
1. **Photo Display**: Modified the item display to show inventory photos (80x80px thumbnails) for each scanned bike/accessory
2. **Price Editing**: Added inline price editing functionality with toggle buttons, allowing modification of both hourly and daily rates
3. **State Management**: Added `editingPrices` state to track which items are being edited
4. **Data Consistency**: Updated `handleBarcodeScanned` to use `photo` field instead of `image` for consistency

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend: Added `completePayment` function in contractController.js with proper validation and history tracking
- Frontend: Enhanced ContractsBeautiful with photo display and price editing UI components
- Database: Extended Contract schema with "returned" status option
- API: New route for payment completion with comprehensive error handling

**Files Modified:**
- Contract model: Added "returned" status enum
- Contract controller: Modified return logic and added payment completion
- Contract routes: Added new payment completion endpoint  
- ContractManager: Enhanced with payment modal and filtering
- ContractsBeautiful: Added photo display and price editing features

The solution maintains backward compatibility while providing a robust payment workflow and enhanced user experience for contract creation. The system now properly tracks contract states and prevents data loss during the return-to-payment process.
