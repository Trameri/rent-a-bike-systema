## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on enhancing the ContractsBeautiful component with two key features: displaying inventory photos for scanned items and enabling price editing for individual articles, while maintaining the existing layout.

**Initial Request**: The user wanted to add inventory photos for each scanned bike/accessory in ContractsBeautiful and provide the ability to modify prices for individual items without changing the existing layout or other functionality.

**Key Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Photo Display Integration**: Modified the item visualization in ContractsBeautiful to show inventory photos alongside each scanned item. The photos are displayed as 80x80px thumbnails with proper error handling if images fail to load.

2. **Price Editing System**: Implemented an inline price editing feature that allows users to modify both hourly and daily prices for each item. The system includes:
   - Toggle between view and edit modes with visual buttons (✏️ to edit, ✓ to confirm)
   - Separate input fields for hourly and daily rates
   - Real-time price updates in the items array
   - Proper state management for tracking which items are being edited

3. **Data Structure Updates**: Modified the `handleBarcodeScanned` function to properly map the `image` field from the inventory to `photo` field for consistent naming throughout the component.

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Added `editingPrices` state object to track which items are in edit mode
- Created `togglePriceEdit()` and `updateItemPrice()` functions for price management
- Enhanced the item display layout to accommodate photos without breaking existing styling
- Maintained backward compatibility with items that don't have photos
- Used flexbox layout to properly align photos, content, and action buttons

**Files Modified**:
- Enhanced ContractsBeautiful.jsx with photo display and price editing capabilities
- Updated item rendering logic to include thumbnail images
- Added inline editing controls for price modification

**Current Status**: The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The system now displays inventory photos for scanned items and provides intuitive price editing functionality while preserving the original layout and user experience. The frontend was restarted to apply changes, though the final startup verification was still in progress when the conversation ended.

**Key Insights for Future Work**: The modular approach used here (adding features without disrupting existing layout) demonstrates good practices for incremental feature enhancement. The price editing system could be extended to include validation rules or bulk editing capabilities if needed in the future.
